JOSEPH H. BARLEY

Mr. Barley came to Wichita in the early 70's, and has since that time lived here. He was well known, as an engineer and had been connected with the Howard Mills for several years in the early years of Wichita's growth.
He had recently been ill with influenza but had been able to walk around the house the past few days. Shortly after 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon he announced his intention of taking a bath, and later his daughter decided to investigate, as she had heard no noise from the bath room.
She found him dead in the bath tub. Neighbors notified Fire Chief Brownwell, who brought the city pulmotor, but all efforts to force the oxygen into the congested lungs failed.
Mr. Barley was born 79-years ago. He is survived by his wife; two daughter Mattie and Josie; and three sons, Charles, Henry and William. Miss Mattie Barley is at Charles P. Mueller's flower shop on East Douglas Avenue.
The body is at the A. G. Mueller chapel awaiting funeral arrangements which have not been made yet.
