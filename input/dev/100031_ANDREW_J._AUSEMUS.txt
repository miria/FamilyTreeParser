ANDREW J. AUSEMUS

The old soldiers are rapidly passing. On Sunday the funeral of Abraham Fields was held by Shiloh Post G. A. R. and A. J. Ausemus took part in the services, acting as chaplain. This was after dinner and before nine o'clock that evening he had passed away. He was stricken just after coming home from the funeral of his comrade, and never spoke a word.
Funeral services were conducted at the residence on Wednesday at 10 o'clock by the Rev. Dixon, and interment made in the Cherokee cemetery. He was a member of the Modern Woodmen of America and had insurance in that lodge. His G. A. R. comrades were present at the cemetery, and it was noticeable that they were few in numbers and very feeble in health.
Andrew J. Ausemus, son of Phillip and Deida Ausemus, was born near Jacksonville, Ill., Dec. 30th, 1842. He was married to Lucinda Henderson, March 11, 1862. To this union were born five children, four of whom survive their father, one having died in infancy. In June, 1852 he enlisted in Co. A of the 68th Regiment of Illinois Volunteers of Infantry. He united with the M. E. Church as Concord, Ill., in 1869. He immediately became an active worker. During the forty-five years of his membership held at various times all the offices of the church to which a lay member is eligible. He was a teacher in the Sunday school each year during that time.
Mr. Ausemus has been a resident of our city for many years and he has been especially active as a member of the Methodist church.
