JOHN W. ANDERSON

John W. Anderson, Adjutant of Osawatomie Post 322, G. A. R., Department of Kansas, answered the last roll call on the morning of November 14th to a higher officer than any before whom he had ever been called. He had been a well known and well loved civil character in Miami county and especially in Osawatomie, where he lived and died.
Everyone knew Uncle Jake, and everyone suffers a sharp pang at the thought of the loss of such a grand old friend. He was a friend indeed to everyone with whom he became acquainted, and his enemies were and are non-existent. He believed in the Golden Rule being lived up to the letter, and if anyone ever tried to do what was right, Uncle Jake not only tried but did.
He was a member of the G. A. R. a member of the Soldiers and Sailors Historical and Benevolent Society and a member of a number of fraternal societies.
J. W. Anderson came to Kansas in 1859 with his parents. He was the oldest son of Henry Anderson and Leavina Anderson and was born in Johnson county, Missouri, March 3, 1849. He was 71 years, 8 months and 11 days old at the time of his death.
His parents brought him to Kansas through hardships unknown and unthought of now a days, having battled across the burning and scorching plains or over the frozen ground in the face of frigid wind in a lynch-pin wagon drawn by oxen, taking their chances with the Indians and the elements, they finally settled near Indianapolis, 3 miles west of Osawatomie.
In the 20th day of February, 1873 Uncle Jake married Marietta Brace at Chatsworth, Illinois and brought his wife back to Kansas on the 24th day of November, 1874, where they lived until her death which occurred on the 11th day of December, 1917.
His military record shows that he enlisted from Miami county, Kansas, the 13th day of November, 1864, to serve two years during the war and was mustered into the United States service at Leavenworth, Kansas, as a private in Capt. John Hall's company G, 16th Regiment. He received an honorable discharge at Leavenworth on the 6th of December, 1865, by reason of the close of the war.
The remains were laid to rest at 2:00 p. m., Tuesday afternoon by the Masonic lodge and the funeral was held at the M. E. church with Rev. Rogers officiating.
