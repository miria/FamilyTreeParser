STEPHEN ARNOLD

The remains of Stephen Arnold, who died at his late home near Hoxie, Sheridan county, Kansas, on Monday of this week, were brought to the cemetery here for burial on Wednesday where a brief funeral service was held conducted by request of the relatives, by Col. Ed. R. Smith.
We learn that Mr. Arnold was a member of Co. D of the 108 Regiment of Ill. Vol. Inf. during the war of the rebellion, and it was his dying request that his body be taken to Mound City for interment in the Soldier's cemetery here. By reason of want of definite information that Mr. Arnold was an "old soldier" the authorities deemed it proper to cause his burial to be made in a lot other than in the government lot which was done to the great regret of the old soldiers here as well as by the relatives of the deceased, as upon the arrival here of the remains accompanied by the widow and two older sons, it was learned that Comrade Arnold was present for duty in line with his comrades during all the bloody battles that finally caused the surrender of Vicksburg, including the battle of Champion Hills, where the Division of which he was a member, lost a third of its fighting force.
We learn that Mr. Arnold was born in Ohio in 1838, and was united in marriage with Miss Sarah Jennings in 1873, to which union seven children were born, five of whom with their mother survive. Mrs. Isaac Gritton, of this vicinity, is the only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Arnold, who with her mother and two sons of the deceased, were present at the funeral. We learn also that Mrs. Arnold is a sister of C. E. and John Jennings of this vicinity, both of whom with their families were present at the funeral service.
