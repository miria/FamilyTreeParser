GEORGE H. ANTHONY

George H. Anthony, born at Shelbyville, Indiana, January 28, 1842, died at the home of his son, Harry, five miles northwest of Altoona, last Sunday morning, January 19th, at 6:30 o'clock, age 76 years, 11 months and 21 days. Funeral services were conducted last Monday at the home by the Rev. J. R. Creamer, of the Altoona Methodist church. Interment was in the Altoona cemetery.
In 1862, Mr. Anthony volunteered for service in the Union army, Company A, 183 Indiana Regiment of Infantry. This regiment was a part of the troops operating along the Mississippi for the capture of Vicksburg. It was finally transferred down the river and disembarked below the city, where it formed a part of General Grant's great army of advance on the historic Rebel stronghold. Mr. Anthony took part in the battles of Raymond, Champion Hills, Big Black River Bridge and in the advance on the city. In this latter he was shot through the left knee while on picket and was so badly wounded as to be put out of the service at once. He returned home in time and had not recovered from his injury when the war closed being unable to join the delegation bound to Indianapolis to welcome the comrades home from the field. When he finally became able to take up the thread of civil life, he engaged in farming as a permanent business, together with the handling of stock.
He was married in July 1865, to Jennie Alves. To this union one child was born, Mrs. Cora Cox, who lives northwest of Altoona. His wife departed this life November 4, 1866. In November, 1867, he was united in marriage to Lyda E. Lingo. Eight children were born to this union, four of whom are living. The young couple came to Kansas in 1869, locating in Greenwood county at what is now Quincy, and six years later came to Wilson county, which was their home until the death of Mrs. Anthony in 1905. In 1908, he was united in marriage to Henrietta Siler, of Fredonia, whose death occurred in August, 1916. They lived in Fredonia for a few years, or until her death, when Mr. Anthony returned to the farm, and has been staying with his sons since. Deceased had been a member of the I. O. O. F. lodge for over fifty years.
Mr. Anthony had enjoyed good health until a year or two ago, when he began to fail, although up until the day before he died he seemed to be in his usual health, and the day before he passed away, he walked to the home of his daughter, Mrs. Cox, and seemed to be in good spirits. Wednesday morning his little granddaughter went to his bed room to awaken him, but was unable to do so, and afterward when other members of the family entered the room, they found the old gentleman helpless. He had suffered a paralytic stroke during the night and never rallied, his life passing away Sunday morning.
George Anthony was a well liked man. Until age compelled him to retire from active work in politics, he was a leader of his party in Wilson county. He was gifted of speech and had a ready, forceful and convincing delivery in his public addresses. His fund of information regarding public questions was apparently inexhaustible and he was a leader in debates. He lived a long and useful life and reared an honorable and industrious family. He leaves to mourn his death, two sons, Harry and Edward, who live northwest of Altoona, and three daughters, all of whom were present at the funeral, except Mrs. J. D. Dunbar of Jena, Louisiana. He leaves a brother, D. D. Anthony, of St. Louis, a half-brother, C. B. Larabee, of Indiana, and many, many friends
