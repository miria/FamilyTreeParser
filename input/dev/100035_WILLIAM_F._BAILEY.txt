WILLIAM F. BAILEY

BAILEYâ€”At Le Roy, Kansas, October 3, 1893, William F. Bailey, Aged 52 years, 5 months and 25 days.
The deceased was born in London, England, April 8, 1841, and came to America at the age of 14 years. After residing for sometime in Canada, he removed to Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he resided for more than ten years. He was married at Buffalo, New York, Oct. 19, 1865. In 1878 he moved with his family to Kansas and for the past dozen years he was a citizen of Le Roy. During the war he served his country well for 2 years and 9 months as a soldier, having enlisted in 1862 and being honorably discharged at the close of the war. In 1884 he joined the G. A. R. He was also a member of the present city council, an honorable citizen, respected by all who knew him, honest in his dealings and upright in his character and actions.
Such is the brief record of the deceased's life as furnished to us by Rev. H. A. Cook who preached an interesting and appropriate sermon Wednesday afternoon at the M. E. church whence the remains were carried to his last resting place, followed by a large concourse of sympathizing neighbors and friends.
As the writer passed by the deceased's place of business the morning after the death, and looked at the crape on the door, a little urchin walked by and shaking his head in a grave manner, said: "The best man in town is gone. He always attended to his own business." The sentiments expressed by the little boy will be indorsed by every citizen of Le Roy. If Mr. Bailey had an enemy in all this country, we have not heard of him. His untimely taking off is sincerely mourned by everybody. He leaves a widow, two sons and one daughter, all grown and able to carry on the business in which he was engaged. They have the sympathy of the entire community.
