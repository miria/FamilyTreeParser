ALEXANDER ALLISON

Grandpa Alexander Allison quietly passed away last night at the home of his son-in-law Wm. Bowers living on South High street. He has been quite sick for some weeks, and it has been his earnest desire to be permitted to live until yesterday as just one year ago yesterday his wife was called from him. The funeral services will take place at Zion Church, west of town at 11 o'clock tomorrow.
Grandpa Allison was born Nov. 24, 1819 and was married March 10, 1842. He was an old soldier enlisting in Co. E, 81st Ohio. He was the father of thirteen children, eleven of whom are grown. He was a man loved by all who knew him. May the relatives who mourn his death receive comfort from on high. He was a member of the Christian church and has been a devoted follower of its principles and teachings for more than sixty years.
