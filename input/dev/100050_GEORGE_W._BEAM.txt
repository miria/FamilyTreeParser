GEORGE W. BEAM

Word was received by relatives in the city last Friday of the death of Captain George W. Beam, a former resident of this county, at Caldwell, Idaho. His death occurred Thursday. The deceased leaves to mourn his loss, besides his beloved companion, four sons, Charles and Fred, at Deering, Earnest at Liberty, and Frank at McPherson, Kansas, and four daughters, Mrs. Daisy Banks and Mrs. Bertha Livingston at Caldwell, Idaho, Mrs. Anna Walton at Deering, and Mrs. Earl Jenkins of this city, besides many friends who knew him while a resident of this county.
Captain Beam was an early settler in Drum Creek township, not far from where Drum Creek Chapel now stands, and a leading citizen in the early days of the county and influential in all good works that went for the betterment and uplift of humanity. He was widely known in the eastern part of the county and in this city and was loved and highly esteemed for his many manly qualities by all who had his acquaintance. Captain Beam was among the first to answer his country's call in 1861, enlisting in Company C, Twenty-first Illinois Infantry, under then Colonel U. S. Grant. After serving his first enlistment he raised a company and was chosen as Captain of Company H, 132nd Illinois Infantry and served until the end of the war. He was a member of McPherson Post of this city and was a loved comrade.
