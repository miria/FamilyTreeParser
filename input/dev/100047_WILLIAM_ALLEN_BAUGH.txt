WILLIAM ALLEN BAUGH

Wm. Baugh was born near Russellville, Kentucky, June 15, 1834. In 1856 he was united in marriage to Nancy J. Hardison and in the same year moved to Illinois. In 1857 he moved to Linn county where he remained until 1889 when he went to a farm near Kincaid remaining there until his death. Thus it will be seen that he had been a citizen of Kansas for more than 55 years.
The wife of his youth passed away in January, 1878, and in 1881 he was married to Mrs. Ida Fuller. To the first union seven children were born. Of the second marriage three children were the issue, viz., Aaron M., Clarence R., and Bartlett Calvin, the later dying in infancy.
Mr. Baugh was a man who won the respect of all with whom he came in contact. He was an upright and honest man, fair and just in all his dealings, kindly and considerate, loyal to friend and just to all. He held the position of Second Lieutenant in Company L, 6th Kansas Militia, doing service along the border and in the Price raid, was in the battles of Hickman's Mill, Westport and the running fight which resulted in the capture of Marmaduke at Mine Creek near Pleasanton.
In a conversation with a comrade of Mr. Baugh, a member of his company, that gentleman remarked, "There was a man who always played his part. A good citizen and an honest man is goneâ Pleasanton Observer.
Funeral services were held at the Presbyterian church on the afternoon of January 9th, conducted by Rev. Shulenberger, and interment was made in the city cemetery.
