JAMES E. ALGER

He was married on Nov. 4, 1866, to Miss Lucy Reeves of Williamston, N. Y. From this union three children were born of whom only Mrs. Grace Johnson, of Douglass, survive. His wife passed away three years ago.
He and his wife moved to Kansas in 1870 and took up land one half mile east of Douglass where they lived for more than 40 years. Becoming too feeble to work his farm he sold it and moved to town about 7 years ago, and there he lived until his death, June 10, 1915, at the age of 80 years, 9 months 20 days.
He and his wife were charter members of the Congregational church of this place, and were active in all kinds of Christian service for nearly half a century. He was installed as deacon of this church Dec. 12, 1877, and faithfully served his church in that capacity until his death.
He was a kindly and generous nature, being one of those rare men who seek out opportunities to do good and whose faithfulness and fidelity in all good work has been constant throughout a long and useful life.
"Uncle James" will be missed not only from the pew he filled in church, but the entire community feel that they have lost a friend who will long be remembered for his many gracious deeds and his sturdy Christian character.
He and his good wife were among the pioneers who helped make Kansas suffering all the hardships of early frontier life, uncomplainingly, and always standing for righteousness. So we can say in the words of Paul what his life has brought out: "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give to me at that day."
