JOHN T. BAKER

Hon. J. T. Baker, of Potawatomie township, died at his home at 9 o'clock Friday night, of a cancerous affection of the stomach.
Mr. Baker was one of the pioneers of Franklin and his sturdy activity and enterprise have been invaluable factors in building up his flourishing section of the county. Nor was his work and influence for improved conditions local. He was broad-gauged and he entered into the affairs of the whole community with an energy and intelligence that was wide-spread in beneficial results.
He was born in Putnam county, Ind., March 2, 1843, and later removed to Jackson county, Mo., where he resided with his parents for a year. He came with them to Franklin county in October 1855. His father, Joshua Baker, located in Potawatomie township and John T. assisted him in farming until 1868, when he began on his own account. In 1875 he moved to the farm he has owned and occupied since, a considerable tract. He engaged extensively in breeding high grades of short-horn cattle and Poland-China hogs. He enlisted Aug. 30, 1862 in Company D, 12th Kansas Infantry, and was mustered out in July, 1865.
Mr. Baker was clerk of his township three terms, and in 1879 was elected a county commissioner. He served two terms. He was elected to the state legislature in 1894 and again in 1898.
He was married in Douglas county, March 4, 1874, to Hattie Ashby, who with two daughters and a son survive him.
The funeral was held at Baker M. E. church Monday at 11 o'clock; interment in Baker cemetery.
