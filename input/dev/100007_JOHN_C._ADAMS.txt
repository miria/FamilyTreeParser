JOHN C. ADAMS

John C. Adams, oldest son of Jabez and Lucinda Adams was born July 12, 1835, in Kentucky, and was therefore over 66 years old. While he was an infant his parents settled in Posey county, Ind., where he spent his childhood and youth. At the age of 18 years the family moved to Marion county, Ill. He has since lived in Mo., Iowa, and Kansas. The last 33 years of his life was spent in Osage county, Kansas-- where he has lived most of the time--the life of a hermit and was familiarly called by all the young folks "Uncle John". His mother was a devoted Christian and worker and taught him in his childhood the noble story of Christ. He has never, during his life, departed from her timely advice and has lived a secluded life. Though eccentric, has always been noted for his pure spotless life, kind, honest and charitable. During the civil war, he served in Co. B, 15th Kansas Cavalry and was honorably discharged October 1865.
