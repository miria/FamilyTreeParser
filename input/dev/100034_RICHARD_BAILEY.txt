RICHARD BAILEY

Richard Bailey was born April 12, 1834, at Devonshire, England. He came to the United States in the spring of 1852 and lived in Monroe county, New York, for three and one-half years when he removed to Peoria county, Illinois, where he remained until the spring of 1884, when he came to Kansas where he has since lived. January 10, 1861, he united with the Baptist church at Kickapoo, Illinois. September 1, 1861, he was mustered into the forty-seventh regiment volunteers, company H, for three years, being discharged from service October 26, 1864. March 31, 1870 he was united in marriage with Mrs. Sara Torrington who died December 31, 1906. April 12, 1914 on his eighteth birthday he united with the Methodist church at Prairie Rose. He leaves two step daughters, Mrs. Mary Ford and Mrs. Mattie Wood with two sisters and two brothers, ten grandchildren and thirty eight great grandchildren and to mourn his loss. He died at his home near Moran, Kans., October 2, 1915, aged 81 years, 5 months and 19 days. Brother Bailey was a good old man. His very congenial spirit throughout his many years of suffering was indeed remarkable. The simple trust in his Savior was indeed very beautiful. The community has lost one of its most faithful church workers. For several years his step-daughter Mrs. Mary Ford, has cared for him in his almost helplessness and the last months wholly invalidism. Our pen fails to do this noble woman in Israel justice for her untiring loyalty to her step-father during all these years of his helplessness. Her reward can not be paid in this life but in her starry crown may the angels of God place many a diadem. She has taught us all one of the most beautiful lessons of the Master's interpretation of the cup of cool water in the name of a disciple which will never lose its reward. Thus we hand a little bouquet to Mrs. Ford and may heaven grant her many happy years among us here and when the Father calls her from us we know it will be a triumphant entry to the beautiful world above.
Brother Bailey's funeral services were conducted at his late home Sunday, October 3 at 1:30 p. m. the Rev. J. H. Oliver conducting the services. The body was laid to rest in the Moran cemetery by the side of his wife.
