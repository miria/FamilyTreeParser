ISAAC ADAMS

Isaac Adams, an old resident of this community, died at his home south of Quenemo last week of a complication of stomach and heart trouble. He was past 73 years of age and a pioneer in Kansas. Funeral services were held at the home conducted by Rev. J. K. Miller and burial was in the Conley cemetery.
Isaac Adams was born in Indiana July 16, 1842. He made his home in several different states before coming to Kansas. Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri each claimed a portion of his life.
He died April 1, 1916 at his home five miles southwest of Quenemo at the age of 73 years, 9 months and 16 days.
He was married in 1876 to Rachel Auxier. To this union six children were born. Two of these preceeded their father into the home beyond, Birdie who died August 21, 1878 and Mrs. Lepha McMillan who died December 26, 1905. The remaining children are: Mrs. Edith Mize, Topeka, Kansas; Mrs. Edna Hohenstein, Blue Mound, Kansas; Mrs. Madge Harvey, Quenemo, Kansas; and Mrs. Grace Sutton, Williamsburg. He leaves besides these children his devoted wife who will miss his tender devotion, his aged brothers, other relatives and many warm friends. He was a man of sterling qualities, deep in his convictions. He loved his home and every member of the home circle. He was a good neighbor and a loyal, true friend.
When the state needed his service he offered himself. He was a member of the Union Home Guards in 1861. He enrolled in Missouri Militia in 1862 and again in 1863. In 1864 he joined the Kansas State Militia known as the "Price Raid" Militia. He was faithful in service to his state as he was to his home.
Many were in attendance at the funeral service showing esteem for the departed and sympathy with the friends. The floral offerings also were very large and beautiful.
We wish to thank the many friends who so kindly assisted us during the illness and death of our beloved husband, father, and brother, also for the beautiful floral offerings.
