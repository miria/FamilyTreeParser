PHILEMON BAKER

Philemon Baker, the aged father of E. S. Baker, residing three fourths of a mile south of Douglass, died Tuesday morning, February 26, after a long season of failing health. His age was 82 years and five months. Mr. Baker was born in Pennsylvania, September 27, 1835. He came west and during the Civil war served his country in the 146th Illinois volunteers.
With his wife and family he came to Kansas in 1888, settling near Dexter in Cowley county. Here the companion of his life passed away nearly 10 years ago. To them seven children were born, but only two survive his: E. S. Baker of Douglass, and John Baker, residing near Newkirk, Oklahoma. Both his sons were with him at the time of his death.
For very many years he had been a devoted member of the Christian church, and his life had been brightened by a living faith in the divine promises.
The body accompanied by those of his relatives here and some friends, was taken to Dexter, Wednesday, where funeral services were held and where it was laid in its last resting place beside his wife.
