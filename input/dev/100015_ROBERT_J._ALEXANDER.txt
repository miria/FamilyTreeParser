ROBERT J. ALEXANDER

A large part of Mound City turned out Tuesday, to do honor to the memory of the late Robert J. Alexander, former businessman and farmer of this place. Mr. Alexander died at the home of his adopted daughter, Mrs. Beulah Flora near Waynoka, O. T., Sunday.
Mr. Alexander was born near Princeton, Ind., in 1832 where he lived with his parents until he was 21 years old, when he went to California with his sister and her husband sailing around Cape Horn. After remaining there about three years, he returned to Indiana.
Mr. Alexander was married in 1855, Miss Fannie Hollis becoming his wife. Four years later, he removed to Tazewell county, Illinois. During the Rebellion he enlisted in the Seventy-third Illinois infantry, serving for three years. He marched to the sea with Sherman, and was in the Stone River, and Knoxville campaigns.
In 1865, Mr. Alexander removed with his family to Mound City where he spent many years. He was engaged in farming and mercantile pursuits until 1893, when he removed to the place where he died.
The body was brought to Mound City, for burial, Tuesday. It was met at the station by the members of the G. A. R. to which he belonged. This same body had charge of the funeral service. The burial was made in the cemetery here, beside his wife, who died in 1889. Mr. and Mrs. Flora accompanied the body here. Besides them, Mr. Alexander leaves three grandchildren Roberta, Frank and Paul Flora. David Alexander, a brother of Elreno, O. T., was unable to be here.
The pall-bearers: J. J. Hawkins, B. B. Carbin, D. R. Lamoreau, O. P. Watson, H. H. Woy, and Robert Kincaid.
