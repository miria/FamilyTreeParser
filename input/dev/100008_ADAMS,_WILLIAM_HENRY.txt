ADAMS, WILLIAM HENRY

 William Henry Adams was born 18 October 1837 in Posey County, Indiana the son of Jabez Adams and Lucinda Cundiff. William Henry was never known to be sick a day. He was always up before sunrise and he never wore an overcoat, gloves, or ear mufflers in even the coldest weather. He was a Lieutenant in the Civil War in the Missouri State Militia, serving under General Lyons in Missouri. He enlisted in the Civil War, 13 August 1862, at Warsaw, Missouri, in Company G, 60th Regiment of the Missouri Militia, under Capt. William Miller, serving from August 13, to December 1, 1862. He later served under Captain W. E. McGinnis in Company H, the Kansas State Militia, being ordered into active service again 13 October 1864 as second lieutenant, serving 109 days. He was a chief spy for General Lyons; this duty was considered a most important one, and was considered an honor to hold it. His spy duty one time was in locating the Rebel General Marmaduke and he was in the regiment that caused Marmaduke's retreat to the South out of Missouri. At one time, while going home on a furlough, he was captured by two rebel soldiers at a farm house where he had stopped temporarily; he asked permission to go to the stable and get his horse and side arms, so he could ride with them to the Rebel camp. He never came back to them but kept going, keeping the barn between him and the rebels, and ducking and hiding behind the gopher mounds and working his way to freedom. At another time he escaped rebels who were close on his trail. He stopped at an old log cabin, and becoming aware that the rebels were after him, he concealed himself behind the stone fireplace, in the space between the fireplace and the log wall. They searched the cabin house to the best of their ability, and certain that he was hiding therein, demanded that the woman of the place tell them his hiding place. She said that she did not know. They left without finding him and he then went to the barn and mounted a colt that had never been "broke," and succeeded in getting back to his regiment.
He had a sandy beard and mustache, black hair, blue eyes, and a small mouth. He was considered dark complexioned. He never smoked, but he did chew Horseshoe tobacco all his life. He had no false teeth in the year 1916. His weight was about 150 lbs, and was about 5 ft., 9 inches tall. He was a rather spare man, and was always ready to talk on any topic of the day. William was always kind to his stock and he had the fattest horses, cows and pigs in the neighborhood. He was very methodical, always wanted his children to go to school, if possible. He would take his children to school a-horse-back thru the deep snow.
William Henry Adams married Mary E(maline) Spurgeon in the Methodist Episcopal Church near Carthage, Missouri, on November 4, 1867. They settled in Newton Co., Missouri.
