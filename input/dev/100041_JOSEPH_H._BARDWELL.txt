JOSEPH H. BARDWELL

J. H. Bardwell of this city, suffered a stroke of apoplexy at the fair grounds at about 4:30 p.m.. Thursday. He was taken at once to his nearby home in north Goodland and medical aid was summoned. Dr. Carmichael came and pronounced it a case of apoplexy. Everything possible was done to recussitate him but without avail, and he sank away and died about 9:30, five hours after the stroke.
The members of the family, living in Cheyenne county, and elsewhere, were notified, and the funeral was held from the house at the Congregational church at 11 o'clock Sunday forenoon, and burial was made in the city cemetery. Rev. J. R. Thomas of the Methodist church preached the funeral sermon and officiated at the interment; the Woman's Relief Corps and the G. A. R. post, of which he was a member, attended in a body, and read the ritual of their orders at the grave. The floral offerings were profuse and beautiful and blooming flowers, evergreens, and the flag, were laid upon the casket in token of regard, sorrow, sympathy and eternal hope.
Comrade Bardwell was quartermaster of the W. S. Robinson Post, and he was also a member and official of the Methodist church. Rev. Thomas took for his text words from Hebrews 11:14-16.
"For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out. they might have had opportunity to have returned. But highly, now they desire a better country, that is. an heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city."  The sermon was appropriate to the occasion.
There was a large attendance at the funeral. The immediate relatives of the deceased present at the funeral were: Mrs. J. H. Bardwell. the widow, and her brother, Rev. James F. Johnson of Luray. Kan.; Alvin Bardwell of Loveland. Colo.; Helen F. Bardwell of Goodland; James L. Bardwell. Walter J. Bardwell. and George I. Bardwell all of Cheyenne county. Kan.; and Earl M. Bardwell of Rivenna. Neb. One daughter. Mrs. Lillie Bardwell Biggs, of Huntington. Ark., was not here at the funeral. All the other living children and several grandchildren were present at the services. Mr. Bardwell. the deceased, has a brother, M. L. Bardwell. residing at Gill. Colo., but was not here at the funeral.
Joseph H. Bardwell was born near Buckville. Ohio, in 1844. In boyhood his parents moved to Michigan and later to Illinois. February 10, 1862. he enlisted in "I" company, First Illinois Light Artillery, and after serving two years he "veteranized." re-enlisted for three more years or the close of the war. He was discharged in Chicago; July 26, 1865, after having served three years and nearly six months. He was united in marriage to Sarah A. Johnson, at Springfield, 111.. August 19, 1869. From this union eight children were born, all living but one son, Harry C. Bardwell, who died in Nashville, Mo., in 1887. The wife and mother, five sons and two daughters, still survive the deceased and deeply mourn his loss. The family moved from Illinois to Missouri, and then to Kansas, where they have since resided. The deceased, when about 25 years of age, was converted and joined the Methodist church, of which religious body he has since been a faithful and consistent member. In the language of the great "Apostle to the Gentiles," he has fought a good fight, he has finished his course, he has kept the faith; and henceforth there is laid up for him a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give him in that day."
"Servant of God, well done! Thy glorious warefare's (sic) past; The battle's fought, the race is won. And thou are crowned at last."
The resident of Mr. Bardwell and family has been quite brief, something like a year or so, in Goodland; but in this short time our people, who have come to know him, have learned to respect him, and those quite intimately acquainted, to esteem him highly. His mild, quiet, unobstrusive (sic) manner has impressed many and prepared the way for lasting friendships. But he has passed to the calm and rest of the "heavenly country."
