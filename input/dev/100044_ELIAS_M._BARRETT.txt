ELIAS M. BARRETT

Death came Monday night to Mr. Elias M. Barrett at his home on South Penn avenue, from an old kidney trouble. He was born in Illinois, Aug. 5, 1837, and at 21 was married to Miss Malinda Martin, who died a few years ago. When the war came he was a free-stater and volunteered in Company B, Ninth Kansas Cavalry, and saw three years hard service. He is survived by two daughters, Mrs. Isabelle Pyle and Mrs. Mary Vice of this city, and five children in other states. The funeral was held today, Rev. W. P. Whaton officiating and the Grand Army conducting their ritual service at the home and interment under auspices of the Sons of Veterans.
