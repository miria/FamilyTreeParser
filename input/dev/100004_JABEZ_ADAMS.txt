Mr. Adams was a pioneer in this part of Kansas. He was anxious for the best things in life and sought them until his health was broken. That dreaded disease cancer fastened itself on him several years ago. He made a hard fight against this enemy. But the enemy conquered. He was patient and hopeful and as cheerful in the fight as one could be. His was a quiet disposition, very thoughtful and earnest.
