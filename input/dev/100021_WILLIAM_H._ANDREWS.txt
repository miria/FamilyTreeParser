WILLIAM H. ANDREWS

William H. Andrews died at his home in this city Wednesday afternoon, March 12, 1902, in the 73rd year of his. Cause of death was hemorrhage. He was born in Astoria, Long Island, N. Y. Sept. 19, 1830. He served three years in the war of the Rebellion, being a member of the 19th Ohio Volunteers and enlisted at Twinsburg, Ohio. He was with General Buell and later with Gen. Rosecrans. He was in several severe engagements during the war and his record is one of honor and bravery. He was in the battles of Shiloh, Stone River, Chickamauga and others. He was mustered out in 1865.
He was married in 1855 to Miss Adeline Redfield at Twinsburg, Ohio.
Was a carpenter by trade, and came to Humboldt in 1866. Was one of the fathers of capitular Masonry in southeast Kansas, and an honorary member of Pacific Lodge, No. 29, A. F. & A. M. and Valley Chapter, No. 11, R. A. M. of this city. He was also a member of Vicksburg Post, No. 72, G. A. R.
During his long residence in Humboldt he has served in various official capacities, having been Justice of the Peace, township trustee, and member of the school board. And in all those thirty-six years of residence here he has always been a friend to all worthy people, and all were his friends. What a blessed remembrance this must be to his sorrowing relatives!
He was a man who was just and fair in all his dealings with mankind, and left a name untarnished by any act of wrong-doing.
We could say much more in praise of our friend, comrade and brother, but the task is a hard one, when we know our eyes shall never more rest upon that grand and noble man, but all knew him, and his many virtues, therefore our words would do no good.
He leaves a devoted wife, two sons, Henry and Orrin, and a host of friends to mourn his sudden departure.
Sunday he returned from a visit to his son, Henry and wife, in Kansas City. On Monday night he was stricken with the fatal sickness. For the past year he has seemed to be failing, but his friends apprehended no early dissolution, and it was a terrible shock to them when it was announced that he was dead.
The funeral services were conducted at the Presbyterian church Friday at 2:30 p. m., the Masonic lodge being in charge, and a large number of friends being in attendance at the church, and following the body to Mt. Hope cemetery where it was buried with Masonic honors.
THE UNION extends sympathy to the bereaved relatives.
