WILLIAM ALSOP

Mr. Alsop enlisted in Co. G, 19th Ill. Vol. Inf. and served in the civil war until he received an honorable discharge.
March 17, 1868 he was married to Miss Mary Jones. To this union were born 4 children, Mmes. W. C. Walker of LaHarpe, D. W. Isaac of Shawnee, Oklahoma and M. H. Williams of San Bernardino, California and Willis Alsop of Fresno, California.
The family moved to Uniontown in 1878 and to Elsmore township in 1880, living there 26 years. Mrs. Alsop died there January 10, 1892 and August 10, 1897, Mr. Alsop married Mrs. Minnie Larkins. One son, Lonnie, who is now 11 years, was the fruit of this marriage.
About four years ago Mr. Alsop moved to a farm in Elm township, near LaHarpe, where the family have since resided.
Mr. Alsop was a consistent Christian, a member of the Adventist church, and was a loving husband, a kind father, a generous neighbor and a loyal friend, held in high regard by all who knew him.
He had not been well for some weeks, troubled much with pleurisy, but Monday before his death he came to LaHarpe and enjoyed a dinner at the home of his grand-daughter, Mrs. Claude Felkins. Tuesday he brought hogs to town. He virtually died in the harness-the way a worker would choose to die.
The three daughters were all present when death came.
The funeral was held at Golden Valley church at two o'clock last Saturday afternoon, Rev. Detro of Iola preaching the sermon. Burial in the Moran cemetery.
