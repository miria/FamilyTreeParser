JOHN ARNOLD

John Arnold was born in South Hamptonshire, England, July 3d, 1831, and died in Larned, August 12th, 1899, aged sixty-eight years one month and nine days. At the age of twenty-three he enlisted in the Crimean war, remaining until peace was declared. Re-enlisting in the regulars, he served five years, during which time he was sent to Canada. When discharged he went to Poughkeepsie, New York, where he engaged in the business of carriage and wagon making. When war broke out in this country he enlisted in the First New York mounted rifle company, where he remained until the close of the war. When a young man he united with the church, and ever thought that his church work was paramount to any other. Only one son survives him, William Arnold, in Wheatland, Wyoming. His love, patience and discreet dealings with his step-children have rendered his bereavement equal to what it would have been if he had been their natural father, and they mourn him with equal grief. Mr. Arnold had been failing for some time, but Friday morning he got worse, when he came in to see the doctor. He kept getting worse, so that he could not get back home, and so was taken to the Presbyterian parsonage, where he died Saturday at 4:45 p.m. The funeral services were held in the Presbyterian church Sunday at 3 p. m., Rev. Fonken preaching from the text, "Death is swallowed up in victory." I. Cor. XV. 54.
The church was crowded. The relief corps, G. A. R., and Daughters of the Rebekka and Odd Fellows attended in a body.
