NOAH ASHER

Rev. Noah Archer, for many years one of the leading ministers of the Methodist Episcopal church in Kansas, died at his home in Hutchinson on Ninth avenue at 10 o'clock Sunday evening. He had been an invalid for several years and was confined to his bed for the past three months. Rev. Asher was deeply loved by the members of his various congregations, by his neighbors, and by all who came in contact with him as a pastor and a man. His life was rich in good works. He was an earnest and untiring servant of the Master, and clung to his life work even after his health and strength had left him.
He was a native of Ohio and was born in 1846. Patriotism was a strong part of his nature as a boy and at the age of 17 he enlisted to serve his country in the 128th Indiana regiment. He was in thirteen battles, and through the Atlanta, Franklin and Nashville campaigns. He received a common school education and later attended two years at Hedding college at Abington, Ill., afterwards teaching school for several years in Illinois and Missouri. In 1872 he removed to Kansas and joined the South Kansas M. E. conference. In his chosen work he was blessed with success. While in the South Kansas conference he was pastor at Girard, La Cygne, Hutchinson, Newton, Belle Plain, again in Hutchinson, Lyons, Canton, Marion, Hadley Chapel at Hutchinson and Augusta. After his first appointment at Hutchinson he served as presiding elder of the Newton district. During his stay at Augusta his health was completely broken down and he was superannuated in March last, and was brought to his home in Hutchinson, when he gradually grew weaker until the end. Rev. Asher was married in 1871, to Mary R. Wyatt in Henderson county, Illinois, and leaves a wife and five children. The hundreds of friends in Kansas will deeply mourn his loss, and many will with the remembrance of him, realize that they are better and truer because of his teachings. He lived a pure, earnest and studious life, leaving the world better than he found it.
The funeral of the late Rev. Noah Asher was held from the First M. E. Church in this city Tuesday morning under the direction of the Knights Templar. Elder George W. Howes of Newton, assisted by Rev. J. W. Anderson of Halstead, had charge of the service. The funeral was attended by the Knights Templar and G. A. R., and a large number of friends of the deceased. The burial occurred at the Eastside cemetery.
