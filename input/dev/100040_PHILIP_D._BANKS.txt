PHILIP D. BANKS

The subject of this sketch was born in the state of Indiana in 1834, and died at his home in this city, April 4, 1902, of Bright's disease, aged 68 years. When about 25 years of age he moved to West Landing, Mo., where he lived until the breaking out of the Rebellion, when he enlisted in the 11th Missouri cavalry and served his country faithfully for over three years.
Shortly after the war Mr. Banks moved to Iowa where he lived several years. Later he came to Kansas, and in 1886 was united in marriage to Mrs. Levina Smith, since which time he has lived in Blue Mound township. About 12 years ago he was converted and united with the M. E. church and has been a faithful member, never neglecting his Christian duties. As the end approached, he expressed entire confidence as to his soul's welfare, and said he was ready to go.
The deceased was a good neighbor and citizen, kind hearted and sympathetic, always full of life and jollity. We are safe in saying that P. D. Banks had as few enemies as almost any man in town, and that his hearty laugh and cheerful presence will be greatly missed by the entire community.
The funeral was held in the M. E. church at 11 a.m. Sunday, April 6, conducted by Rev. S. P. Cullison, and the remains laid to rest in Pleasant View cemetery. It was one of the largest attended funerals in our town for several years.
The bereaved wife, daughters and son, and adopted daughter, Miss Nannie Johnson have the hearty sympathy of the entire community in their deep sorrow.
