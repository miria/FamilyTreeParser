CARR CARY

Mr. Carry was driving home from his place of work to dinner, when near the Catholic church, it seems that his horse become frightened and in his attempting to get out of the buggy he was thrown violently on his neck and head, causing internal injuries which produced unconsciousness. He was at once carried into the home of Frank Cox, near by, where medical assistance was called, but of no avail. He died within a few minutes. Mr. Carry served as a soldier through the entire war and was a member of the 13th Indiana Regiment. He was 56 year old and leaves four grown children and a wife to mourn his death.
The funeral services were conducted at the house under the auspices of Ad Astra Post. Rev. A. M. Barrett, of the Presbyterian church preached the funeral sermon, assisted by Rev. Stafford of the M. E. church. The interment was at the Elmwood cemetery attended by a large number of sympathizing friends.
