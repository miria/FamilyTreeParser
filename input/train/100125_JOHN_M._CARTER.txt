JOHN M. CARTER

 Comrade John M. Carter died at the family home at 1020 West Main, Saturday at age of eighty years, one month and twenty-five days. He was born in Fountain county, Indiana, in 1828, and at the age of nineteen volunteered as a soldier and went with General Winfield Scott to the Mexican war and was at the storming of Vera Cruz. When President Lincoln called for "300,000 more" in defense of the Union, Comrade Carter came to the front and enlisted in B company First Indiana Cavalry. When the war was over and the soldier boys faced westward to subdue the almost trackless Kansas plains, he went in a prairie schooner to Marshall county and settled in Marysville in October, 1866, where he resided for eighteen years, when he sought a miler climate, locating in Harper county. There he remained twenty-two years until he moved to Independence where he lived until his decease. He was made a Mason in 1866 and was a charter member of the Marysville Lodge. He was also a member of the G. A. R. Post at Harper. The funeral was held Sunday afternoon, at which his pastor, Rev. J. A. Longston spoke words of comfort and cheer and the interment was in charge of Fortitude Lodge A. F. and A. M. He leaves a widow, one daughter, Mrs. McIntire, at Cheney, and three sons, Marsh at Anthony, Manson at Elk City, and Volney P. Carter, who resides in our city and is manager of the Rock Island Lumber Yard.
