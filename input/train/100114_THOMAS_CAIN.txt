THOMAS CAIN

Thos. Cain was born June 24, 1844 in Ireland, and died February 22, 1912, at his home in Burlingame, Kansas. 
When about three years of age his parents came to America, locating near Waynesville, Indiana, where Mr. Cain's boyhood days were spent. His parents were poor and his chances for an education were meager indeed, receiving only a common school education and in that way laid the foundation for acquiring a very practical education later in life. On December 30, 1863, having arrived at the age of 19, he enlisted in the 8th Indiana Cavalry, and served to the end of the war. He went with General Sherman on the famous march to the sea, and this campaign and his military service made a very deep impression upon him, and constituted a memory always cherished. 
Returning from the war, he was married to Catherine Spidel in 1868, on the 16th day of January, and this faithful helpmeet survives him. To them five children were born as follows; Oliver, who died in September, 1906, at the age of thirty-seven; Jacob R., James W., May Ellen, who died in 1882 at the age of one year, and Chas. C., all of Burlingame vicinity, who survive him. He is also survived by seven grandchildren. 
Mr. and Mrs. Cain moved to the vicinity of Burlingame in 1870, and ever since has made their home here. Their thrift, prudence and industry brought them financial comfort and influence, and a few years ago they retired from the farm and from active life, and came to Burlingame to rest.
