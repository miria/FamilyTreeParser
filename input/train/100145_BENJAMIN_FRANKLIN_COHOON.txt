BENJAMIN FRANKLIN COHOON

To the union of Mr. and Mrs. Cohoon were born six children four boys and two girls, four of whom, two boys and two girls survive him. They are Franklin Henry of Kiowa, Kans., Ulysses Grant and Mrs. Flora Borah of Parsons and Ella Louise of this city.
While a resident of Illinois he accepted Christ as his Savior and united with the United Bretern church of which he was a faithful member for many years. Upon moving to Iowa he united with Methodist Episcopal church and was a loyal worker in it.
He was a faithful and loving husband, a kind and affectionate father and a citizen revered and respected by all and a host of friends will weep upon this occasion.
For many years he has been an active member of the I. O. O. F. No. 244 and his brothers will miss him from their councils. He was a member of the G. A. R. and his death is a forceful reminder that they all shall soon answer the last call on earth and await the final call on the other shore.
Funeral services were held at the home Sunday afternoon conducted by Rev. H. I. Bailey of the M. E. church after which the burial ceremony was performed by the I. O. O. F. order No. 244, at the Altamont cemetery.
