On Monday, September 18, Jesse Coffman died in this city. He had been in poor health for several months and it was commonly known that his days on this earth were numbered. He was one of the most highly respected citizens who ever resided in Erie and possessed that very rare quality of knowing how to make many friends and very few enemies. The following is a brief history of the life-time happenings of the late Jesse Coffman.

In 1869, he with his wife and little daughter, came to Kansas by wagon route and settled on a claim in Ladore township. He lived there until 1881, when he moved to a farm near Moran, Allen county, Kansas. In 1903 he moved to Erie and in 1909 to Emporia where he resided until his death. He was an active member of the Christian church.
He was twice married, his first wife having died in 1879. He leaves a wife, one daughter, Mrs. F. M.
