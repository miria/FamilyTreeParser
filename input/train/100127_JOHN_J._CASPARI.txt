JOHN J. CASPARI

The deceased held a wonderful and unusual record, for he was the father of ten children, only one of which died, the grandfather of 28 and the great grandfather of 18. All of his grandchildren are living, most of them in Columbus. The names of his children follow: Mrs. Sarah Holland of Scammon; Mrs. Mary Fulet Columbus; Mrs. Anna Butler, Merion, Ill.; Harry Caspri, Columbus, Elda Caspri Columbus; John Caspri, Columbus and Fred Caspri, Columbus.
Mr. Caspri was 88 years old. He was a retired farmer, having lived for a number of years on a farm just north of Columbus. Lately he has stayed at the home of his daughter in Scammon, where he was stricken with paralysis. The effects of this combined with nepritis, caused his death. The deceased has the distinction of being an old soldier of the Civil War.
