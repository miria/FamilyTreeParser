JAMES R. CLERIHAN

Mr. Clerihan's death was very sudden. He had laid off from his work for a few days last week, but served rural route mail number three Friday and Saturday. Monday morning he got his horse ready to go out again, but got to feeling badly and notified a neighbor to send for a substitute. He continued to grow worse, and was taken to Girard Hospital, where he died at four o'clock in the afternoon. The body was taken to Gardner Funeral Parlors and prepared for burial. Relative at Jacksonville, Chicago, Ill., and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma were notified, and after their arrival the time of the funeral was fixed for 9:30 this forenoon under the auspices of Gen. Bailey Post No. 49, G. A. R., interment to be made in Beulah cemetery.
Mr. Clerihan was a native of Ireland, coming to the United States in early manhood. During the civil war he served in the 6th Illinois Cavalry. After the war he came to Kansas and located on a farm near Beulah.
Later he removed to Girard and March 15, 1901 became rural carrier on route three, which he served to the time of his death, being always on time and always ready to do his duty. His wife died nearly three years ago.
The body will be taken from his late residence at 9:30 sharp.
