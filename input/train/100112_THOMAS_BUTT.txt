THOMAS BUTT

Monday night Mr. Butt returned from the meetings somewhat fatigued, and complaining of being ill. He was restless and could not sleep. Tuesday, seeming to be growing worse. Dr. Gulick was sent for and came at once. He was practically dying when the doctor arrived but lingered until a new day broke on this world, and a brighter day on his freed spirit, where ''there shall be no more night."
He leaves a wife and three sons, John. William and Roy, and three daughters, Mrs. E. J. Denney, Mrs. L. Jewell, living in Colorado Springs and Mrs. Joseph McDowell, living in Denver. Telegrams were sent out to the absent ones bearing the sad news of the father's death, and preliminary arrangements made for the funeral. 
Thomas Butt served throughout the civil war in company A Forty-second Illinois infantry, enlisting early in 1861. and being mustered out for disability July 7. 1865. He was a musician, a bugler, but took part in many battles, one affair especially daring, the capture of Island No. 10 by night by troops in a fleet of small boats supported by artillery and gun boats. The writer of this article heard him give a very graphic and accurate account of this daring assault at a G. A. R. encampment at St. Francis several years ago. He usually attended when possible, district, state, and national encampments, the last two of the latter being those held at Denver and Minneapolis. He was a member of the local G. A. R. post, from the very first organization some twenty years ago, and was at the time of his death officer of the day of that body in this city; and was also one of the charter members of the Union Hall association.
Thomas Butt was born in 1840, and was 66 years of age at the time of his death. He was one of the early settlers of the county. An old landmark has fallen.
