GEORGE C. CHANEY

 Independence mourns the loss of one of its high type, Christian soldier citizens in the death of Dr. George C. Chaney, a resident for thirty-nine years, an official and stalwart member of the Christian church and twice Mayor of our city, and faithful to every trust.
 He was an Ohioan by birth and when soldiers were needed to offer themselves, a sacrifice, he answered and volunteered in 167th Ohio Infantry. In 1878 he was married to Miss Sarah VanBerklow, and soon after faced westward to make a home. A year was spent in Roscoe, MO., in practice and as a druggist, and they came to our city and became active workers in all that was for good. Two children were born to them, but Everett was called to rest about the time he graduated as a physician, and the other, Earl Chaney, and family, is left to care for the devoted wife and mother. A sister, Mrs. McClelland, resides in Nebraska.
 The doctor was not only a soldier but a physician with wide and successful practice and lived his Christian profession. He was born June 2, 1845 and retained an up-town office until two years ago when he tried to retire, but served those calling at his home.
 The funeral was held from the home this afternoon at 2:30, in charge of his pastor, Rev. G. W. Pettit, of the Christian church, and his pall bearers were the associates of the official board, and was largely attended by the Grand Army and the Masonic brethren, as well as by the citizens generally.
 Interment in Mount Hope.
