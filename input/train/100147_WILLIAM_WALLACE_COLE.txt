WILLIAM WALLACE COLE

Mr. Cole is survived by one son, Don Cole, and the latter's wife and daughter, Katherine, who live in Chicago; and one sister, Mrs. M. E. Halloway, whose home is at Oskaloosa, Ia. Mr. and Mrs. Cole came immediately upon receipt of the sad news and remained over several days. The funeral was held Monday afternoon from the Methodist church, Rev. T. M. Bell officiating. Burial was at Oak Hill cemetery.
Mr. Cole was born near Marietta, Ohio, September 18, 1839. When a boy he removed with his parents to Kirksville, Ia. At the first call for three-month volunteers in 1861 he enlisted and at the expiration of that time re-enlisted as a private in Company K, Second Iowa Infantry, serving with it until the end of the war. He was at the battle of Fort Donalson and later at Shiloh. He took much pleasure in telling of his march to the sea with Sherman. He was never wounded but spent many days in the hospitals as a result of rheumatism. After returning to his home in Iowa he was married to Julia Battelle Dana. To this union two sons were born, Charles and Don. In 1885 he removed with his family to Columbus, Kas. then to Chetopa where he had since lived. Charles the oldest son, died December 19, 1897, and November 13, 1907, Mrs. Cole died. Mr. Cole had served as a member of the city council and was at one time city marshal.
Mr. Cole was a good specimen of our old soldier element. He was always honest and honored, a kind and devoted husband and father.
