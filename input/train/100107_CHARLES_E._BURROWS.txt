CHARLES E. BURROWS

"Charlie Burrows is dead." This was the news that passed from lip to lip as the older residents of Wichita met on the streets this morning. Charles E. Burrows, desk sergeant at the police station, and formerly chief of police of Wichita, died at his home, 1153 University avenue, at 9:25 o'clock last night. He was taken with a chill at his work last Thursday, and went home feeling quite ill. No one thought his illness was serious at the time, but two or three days ago it became apparent that his condition was critical. He was in a stupor all day yesterday and finally breathed his last without pain, being apparently asleep at the time.
Mr. Burrows was born in Milford Center, Ohio, August 19, 1846. Although but a boy he enlisted in the Second Illinois cavalry and served during the Civil War. At the close of the war he returned to Illinois, where he was married, and where he lived till 1885, when with his family he moved to Cheney, this county.
Mr. Burrows was at one time a perfect specimen of physical manhood and he has always been noted as a man of excellent character. Few men were better known or more thoroughly respected by the pioneers of Wichita.
Mr. Burrows leaves a wife and four children, most of whom were at his bedside at the time of his death. The children are, Mrs. Ella Way, of Hutchison; Mrs. Maude Rotan, 408 South Water street, this city; Clarence R. Burrows, 1118 Texas avenue, this city; and Mrs. Jessie I. Benton, Sandford, Fla. He was a member of the Trinity Methodist Episcopal church, the local G. A. R. and the Fraternal Aid. Funeral services will be held at Trinity church tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 in charge of A. B. Hestwood, the pastor.
Another Comrade has passed away---Charles E. Burrows. A car will be at the Trinity M. E. church at 3:30, December 29, to carry the post and W. R. C. members to cemetery. The post will charge of the services at the grave.
